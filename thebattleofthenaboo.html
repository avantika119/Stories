<h1 style="background-color: lightslategrey;">The Battle Of Naboo</h1>
<p style="background-color: lightslategray;">he Battle of Naboo,[18] also known by names such as the Battle of the Great Grass Plains[19] and the Assault on Theed,[20] was the final conflict of the Invasion
     of Naboo that occurred in 32 BBY. Queen Padm√© Amidala of the Naboo formulated the plan to end the invasion, enlisting the help of the Gungan Grand Army to stage a diversion while the Queen battled to retake the planet's capitol and capture the Trade Federation's Viceroy, Nute Gunray. 
     As the Gungans engaged the Trade Federation Droid Army on the Great Grass Plains, Amidala's strike force infiltrated the capital city of Theed, and also freed the pilots of Bravo Flight to engage the Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa in orbit, which controlled the Trade Federation's droid army. 
     The battle came to an end when the young boy Anakin Skywalker destroyed the Control Ship,
      disabling the Federation's forces,
      and Amidala captured Viceroy Gunray in Theed.</p>
