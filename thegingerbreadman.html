<h1 style="text-align: center; color: white; background-color: burlywood;">The Gingerbread Man</h1>
<p style="background-color: burlywood;">In the 1875 St. Nicholas tale, a childless old woman bakes a gingerbread man, who leaps from her oven and runs away. The woman and her husband give chase, but are unable to catch him. The gingerbread man then outruns several farm workers, farm men, and farm animals.

    I've run away from a little old woman,
    A little old man,
    And I can run away from you, I can!
    The tale ends with a fox catching and eating the gingerbread man who cries as he is devoured, "I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!"[3]
    
    Variations on the 1875 story
    The Gingerbread Man remains a common subject for American children's literature into the 21st century. The retellings often omit the original ending ("I am quarter gone... I am half gone... I am three-quarters gone... I am all gone!")[1] and make other changes. In some variations, the fox feigns deafness, drawing the Gingerbread Man closer and closer. Then the fox snatches and devours him. In other versions, the Gingerbread Man halts in his flight at a riverbank, and after accepting the fox's offer to ferry him across, is convinced by the fox to move ever-forward toward the fox's mouth.
    
    In some retellings, the Gingerbread Man taunts his pursuers with the famous line:
    
    Run, run as fast as you can!
    You can't catch me.
    I'm the Gingerbread Man!

    The End
